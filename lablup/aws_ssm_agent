AWS Systems Manager provides a feature named "Session Manager".

Its origination is batch-oriented command execution and result queries, but now it is extended to support real-time shell sessions streamed via AWS APIs.

The advantage is that we can restrict the access using IAM policies and store the session interaction logs to S3 or CloudWatch streams.



At the time of writing (2018 Dec.), it requires two components: AWS CLI and session-manager-plugin.



SSM Agent Session (mandatory)



0) First you need to have an IAM account and API keypair associated with it.



1) Install AWS CLI on your platform. On macOS, you may use homebrew. Or you may just create a Python virtualenv and install awscli via pip.



2) Run "aws --profile lablup configure" and set your IAM keypairs with the region "ap-northeast-2".



3) Git clone "https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-cloud-scripts" and install it using "pip install -e ." in a Python virtualenv (where aws cli is available).



4) Run "bai-cloud --help" command to see available commands.



5) Visit https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html 
and follow instructions to install session-manager-plugin.

Sometimes the session manager plugins is updated silently.

Check the version by "session-manager-plugin --version" command and compare with the latest version specified the linked webpage.



6) Now you can use "bai-cloud ssh-instance" command to open a shell session to EC2 instances.



Native SSH/SCP access (optional)



NOTE: AWS updated SSM and session-manager-plugin on July 2019 to support native SSH tunneling.



0) First, grab "devops.pem" from our shared file repository and put it to your ~/.ssh directory.
Also, update your session-manager-plugin and the SSM agent in the target servers.



1) Add the following setting to your ~/.ssh/config



host i-* mi-*

  User devops

  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/devops.pem

  ProxyCommand sh -c "aws --profile lablup ssm start-session --target %h --document-name AWS-StartSSHSession --parameters 'portNumber=%p'"



2) Then you can do:



ssh $(bai-cloud get-instance <instanceTagName>)

scp somefile $(bai-cloud get-instance <instanceTagName>):remotepath



Sometimes, the official snap repository falls behind the latest release, thus downgrading of the agent happens a few times per day due to snap's auto refresh.

Try this to keep a more recent version:



sudo snap switch --channel=candidate amazon-ssm-agent

sudo snap refresh amazon-ssm-agent
